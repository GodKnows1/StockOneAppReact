Steps (For the localhost):
1. Download he code from react part and this repository.
2. Open the code in the IDEs : eclipse and VSCode (You can choose of your own)
3. Run the react code -> Go to that folder in terminal and run the cmd < npm start >
4. For the Java side just run the project and it will be at localhost:8080
5. after both running go to localhost:3000/login
